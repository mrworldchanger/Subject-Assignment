        <h1>Types of Audio Supported By HTML</h1>
    </div>
   <div class= "Data">
		<p>There are Basically Three Type of Audio Supported By HTML-</p>		
		<p>1. MP3</p>
		<p>2. OGG</p>
		<p>3. WAV</p>
		<h3>1. MP3</h3>
		<p>	MP3 (formally MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III) is a coding format for digital audio developed largely by the 
		Fraunhofer Society in Germany, with support from other digital scientists in the US and elsewhere. Originally defined as the third audio 
		format of the MPEG-1 standard, it was retained and further extended — defining additional bit-rates and support for more audio channels — as 
		the third audio format of the subsequent MPEG-2 standard. A third version, known as MPEG 2.5 — extended to better support lower bit rates — is 
		commonly implemented, but is not a recognized standard.

		MP3 (or mp3) as a file format commonly designates files containing an elementary stream of MPEG-1 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio encoded data, 
		without other complexities of the MP3 standard.</p>

		<h3>2. OGG</h3>
		<p>	Ogg is a free, open container format maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation. The creators of the Ogg format state that it is unrestricted 
		by software patents and is designed to provide for efficient streaming and manipulation of high-quality digital multimedia. Its name is 
		derived from "ogging", jargon from the computer game Netrek.
		
		The Ogg container format can multiplex a number of independent streams for audio, video, text (such as subtitles), and metadata.

		In the Ogg multimedia framework, Theora provides a lossy video layer. The audio layer is most commonly provided by the music-oriented Vorbis 
		format or its successor Opus. Lossless audio compression formats include FLAC, and OggPCM.</p>

		</audio>
		<br>

		<h3>3. WAV</h3>
		<p>	Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE,or WAV due to its filename extension; pronounced "wave") is an audio file format 
		standard, developed by IBM and Microsoft, for storing an audio bitstream on PCs. It is an application of the Resource Interchange File 
		Format (RIFF) bitstream format method for storing data in "chunks", and thus is also close to the 8SVX and the AIFF format used on Amiga 
		and Macintosh computers, respectively. It is the main format used on Microsoft Windows systems for raw and typically uncompressed audio.
		The usual bitstream encoding is the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format.</p>
