			The version history of the mobile operating system iOS, developed by Apple Inc., began with the release of iPhone OS 1 for the original iPhone on June
			29, 2007. Since its initial release, it has been used as the operating system for iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, and HomePod, seeing continuous 
			development since then, resulting in new major releases of the software typically being announced at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 
			and later released in September, coinciding with the release of new iPhone models. The latest stable version, iOS 14.4, was released on January 26, 
			2021.
