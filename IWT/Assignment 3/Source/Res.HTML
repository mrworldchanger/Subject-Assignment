        <h1>Different Video on the Basis of Resolution</h1>
    </div>
   <div class= "Data">
		<p>Video resolution in a display device refers to the number of distinct pixels that could be displayed in each dimension. It is usually 
		quoted as width× height; for an example: “1024 × 768″. In this example 1024 indicates the width and 768 indicates the height that the display
		could be resolved in pixels.   A display resolution is controlled by factors like the cathode ray tube and flat panel display which are 
		presented in digital televisions and computer monitors.</p>
		<p>There are two types of video resolution: Standard Definition (SD) and High Definition (HD). The most popular standard resolutions are 
		640×360 and 640×480 for video, and 720×480 and 720×576 for DVD. HD video usually has a resolution of 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p, 
		is also known as Full HD).</p>
