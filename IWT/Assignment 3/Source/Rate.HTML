        <h1>Different Video on the Basis of Frame Rate</h1>
    </div>
   <div class= "Data">
		<p>A frame rate refers to the number of individual frames or images that are displayed per second of film or TV display. The frame rates for 
		TV and films are standardized by The Society of Motion Picture and Television Editors, also known as SMPTE.There isn’t technically a 
		“best frame rate” for shooting video. It is based on the look you want to achieve. Movies and films are almost exclusively projected at
		24 frames per second. Television does not have an internationally accepted frame rate. PAL and SECAM use 25 FPS in Europe and in Japan 
		they use 29.97 NTSC.</p>
		<p>Increase in Frame Rate decrease the Speed of Video and It Creates Slow Motion</p>
