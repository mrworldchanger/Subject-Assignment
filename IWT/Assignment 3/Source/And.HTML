        <h1>History of Andriod</h1>
    </div>
   <div class= "Data">
		<p>
			In 2005, the next big chapter in Androidâ€™s history began when the original company was acquired by Google. Rubin and other founding members 
			stayed on to continue developing the OS under their new owners. The decision was made to use Linux as the basis for the Android OS. That meant that the 
			operating system could be offered to third-party mobile phone manufacturers for free. Google and the Android team felt the company could make money 
			offering other services that used the OS, including apps.
			Rubin stayed at Google as head of the Android team until 2013, when the Mountain View company announced he would be leaving the division. 
			In late 2014, Rubin left Google altogether and launched a startup business incubator before eventually returning to the smartphone business 
			with the ill-fated Essential in 2017.
