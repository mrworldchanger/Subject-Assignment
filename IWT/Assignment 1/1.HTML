			 Elon Reeve Musk FRS is a business magnate, industrial designer and engineer.He is the founder,CEO, CTO and chief designer of SpaceX; early investor, CEO and product 
			 architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society 
			 (FRS) in 2018. Also that year, he was ranked 25th on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People, and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative
			 Leaders of 2019. A centi-billionaire, Musk became the richest person in the world in January 2021.Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised 
			 in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of 
			 Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material
			 sciences at Stanford University, but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He co-founded Zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $307 million
			 in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion 
			 in October 2002.In May 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is CEO and lead designer. He joined Tesla Motors, 
			 Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, becoming its product architect that year and its CEO in 2008. In 2006, 
			 he helped create SolarCity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of Tesla). In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote 
			 friendly artificial intelligence. In July 2016, he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces. In December 2016, Musk 
			 founded The Boring Company, an infrastructure and tunnel construction company focused on tunnels optimized for electric vehicles. In addition to his primary business pursuits,
			 he envisioned an open-source high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop based on the concept of a vactrain.Musk has also been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox 
			 or unscientific stances and highly publicized controversies. Following the rejection of a prototype submarine from Tesla that Musk had offered to be used in the 2018 Tham Luang cave 
			 rescue, he insulted a diver who advised in the rescue and disparaged the prototype and in response the diver sued for defamation; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. Also in 
			 2018, he falsely tweeted that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla at $420 a share. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued him for the comment. He
			 settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has received substantial criticism for his views on 
			 artificial intelligence (AI), public transportation, and the COVID-19 pandemic.

			grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian.His paternal grandmother had both British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.After his parents divorced in 1980,
			Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of Pretoria, a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his 
			father, whom he has described as "a terrible human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done."He also has a half-sister and a half-brother on
			his father's side.Musk graduated from Pretoria Boys High School in South Africa.At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing while using the Commodore VIC-20. 
			He learned computer programming using a manual and, by age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for 
			approximately $500.An awkward and introverted child,Musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after a group of boys threw him down a 
			flight of stairs.He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria Boys High School.Although his father insisted 
			that he attend college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United States, saying, "I remember thinking and seeing that America is where great things are possible, 
			more than any other country in the world."Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,he applied for a Canadian passport through his 
			Canadian-born mother.
